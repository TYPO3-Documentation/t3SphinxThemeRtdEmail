            <p>
                thank you very much for providing a TYPO3 project that contains documentation.
                I am <a href="https://github.com/marble/Toolchain_RenderDocumentation" target="_blank">RenderDocumentation</a>,
                the toolchain that builds documentation for you on the
                <a href="http://docs.typo3.org/" target="_blank">TYPO3 documentation server</a>.

                <h2>Attention: You must do this once!</h2>
                <p>
                    The format of the settings has changed:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Settings.yml</em> is the OLD format.<br>
                    <em>Settings.cfg</em> is the NEW format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have found the old format but I did not find the new format in your project.
                    So I generated a new <em>Settings.cfg</em> file from the old one.
                    <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/drafts/github/T3DocumentationStarter/Public-Info-001/stable/_buildinfo/DearProjectOwner.txt"
                       target="_blank">
                        Please download the new file</a> and add it to your project as <em>PROJECT/Documentation/Settings.cfg</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the moment we are in a phase of transition. So please keep the old Yaml file
                    <em>Settings.yml</em> as well. Once it is not needed any more I will
                    let you know.

            <h4>Why do you get this mail?</h4>
            <p>
                I am sending this mail because I found an entry like
            </p>
            <pre>[notify]
about_new_build = email-1, email-2, ...</pre>
            <p>
                in the settings file PROJECT/Documentation/Settings.cfg. Therefore I'm
                sending this report to abc@mail.com, bcd@mail.com.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I have looked around for email addresses in the project and found something.
                So I'm sending this report to abc@email.com, bcd@email.com.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Actually, I will not really send a mail in the end because I saw that
                <em>no</em> in the list of possible receivers. But I still compile this info.
            </p>
            <hr>

            <h4>Do this: Configure emailing</h4>
            <p>
                Add a setting to PROJECT/Documentation/Settings.cfg to specify what you want:
            </p>
            <pre>[notify]
# have one or more receivers notified
about_new_build = email-1 [, email-2, ...]

|notify]
# turn off notification mails like so:
about_new_build = no</pre>

            <h4>Tips</h4>
            <p>
                Have an eye on the <a href="#" target="_blank">BUILDINFO</a> folder.
                It contains information about the most recent build and only
                changes when a new build is run.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="#" target="_blank">HTML</a> is the usual output.
                Most manuals on the server share the same static files.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="#" target="_blank">SINGLEHTML</a>
                has everything in one html file.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="#" target="_blank">PDF</a>
                is a pdf file generated from LaTeX - if everything went well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="#" target="_blank">PACKAGE</a>
                is a zip archive with the HTML output. It is well suited
                for offline reading since css and js files are included
                and paths are relative. If a PDF was generated that file
                is included too.
            </p>
